# Encoder-Decoder
This Tutorial demonstrate the common segmentation model with various encoder and decoder.
The notebooks will be build using tf-slim api.

# Requirement
tensorflow 1.0
Pillow (for read, write image)

# segnet
[SegNet](http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.00561) is a basic Encoder-Decoder model.
The image and label used in this demo are from [CamVid](http://mi.eng.cam.ac.uk/research/projects/VideoRec/CamVid/) dataset.

# U-Net 
[TODO]
